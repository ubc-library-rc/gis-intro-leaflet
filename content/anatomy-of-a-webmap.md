# Anatomy of a Web Map

There are 4 basic component to a web map: **Tiles**, **Data**, **Style**, and **Interaction**. These work in concert to power a functioning web map. The remainder of this workshop will introduce you to each component through hands-on experimentation. First, we'll look at the code a web map powered by Leaflet in order to understand the anatomy of a web map. Then, you will learn to add and style data, as well as configure the interactivity of your web map.
