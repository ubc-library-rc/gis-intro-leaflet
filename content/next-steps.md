# Next Steps
If this workshop has inspired you to expand your skills, try making another map on your own using data for a different location on your own. This will give you some clarity around where you might have some gaps in understanding. Remember, you can create your own GeoJSON with free tools like [geojson.io](http://geojson.io).

***Keep in mind that not all data will be nicely packaged and cleaned. In fact, it never is. If you proceed to use data that you've found on the web, be prepared to spend time preparing your data to be usable with Leaflet and the web.***

This workshop builds from several other resources for web mapping. Here are some great places to start extending your knowledge:

Web map basics: [Anatomy of a Web Map - Alan McConchie and Beth Schechter](http://maptime.io/anatomy-of-a-web-map/)    
Leaflet basics: [Leaflet Quick Start Guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/)   
Web map functionality examples: [Mapbox.js Examples](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/)    
GeoJSON: [More than you ever wanted to know about GeoJSON - Tom MacWright](https://macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html)    
    

## Adding more elements to your Leaflet web map
You may want to add a legend or title, cluster data, or further style your map. While [Leaflet Docs](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html) and [Leaflet Tutorials](https://leafletjs.com/examples.html) document how to do much of this, there is a wealth of documentation online from people tweaking given code to meet their specific needs. So, if you have something specific in mind, we recommend you do an internet search to see what's out there you could draw inspiration (and often code) from. 

For example:
- [Customizing icons in Leaflet]
- [Grouping layers]
- [Creating heatmaps with Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html#heatmaps)
- [Creating cluster maps with Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster), see this [example](https://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.markercluster/example/marker-clustering-realworld.388.html)
- [Creating time sliders with Leaflet]
- [Creating choropleth maps with Leaflet]
- [Leaflet plugins](https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html) offer extended functionality, making leaflet hugely customizable. Below are some plugins to give you some idea of the variety of added functionality that comes from the community of developers. 
- [Adding side panels/menus to a Leaflet web map](https://unbam.github.io/Leaflet.SlideMenu/)
- [Another side bar example](https://github.com/noerw/leaflet-sidebar-v2); (see demo [here](https://noerw.github.io/leaflet-sidebar-v2/examples/))
- [Overlay layers control](https://leafletjs.com/examples/layers-control/)
- Create a [side panel](https://github.com/maxwell-ilai/Leaflet.SidePanel) (scroll down to see [example](https://maxwell-ilai.github.io/Leaflet.SidePanel/examples/))

^^ could do demo about the above, and cite references drawn from...
