- add markers --> libraries  - this could be for google my map - adding a dataset (csv) - parks could be for umap. 

- adding markers can be with community gardens
- clustering could be with parks-points; cottonwood treas
- showing parks could be parks, polygons, 
- creat marker custon etc.
- look into adding /including photo in popup. maybe do for one place, like jrogers swings. 
- mention - layers in geojson HAVE TO BE wgs84, and then wrap as variable (show how) --> show how to style too the polygons!! 

- first just ad the polygons, then show them how its being added - layers etc. (see right above) 

- first ad one marker, then add ibraries or community gardens with popups - show data etc (see above above) then add points and cluster, then add polygons and style, then have them do one on their own. next steps could include adding image to single marker. they can choose coordinates, but have pic of jr park, for example. or granville bridge. 

- do custom marker text for community gardens. 

# Hands On with Leaflet
!! but have a hands on with like, umap!! or at least that documentation or with google my maps (must be csv)

This section will guide you through building an interactive web map powered by Leaflet. To begin, we will look at the boilerplate code that loads a basemap in order to understand what each element does. Then, we will add data to create an interactive map visualizing UBC-V campus buildings.

There are 4 basic component to a Leaflet web map: **Tiles**, **Data**, **Style**, and **Interaction**. These work in concert to power a functioning web map. Over the course of the Hands-On activities that follow, you will have a chance to experiment with each component.
