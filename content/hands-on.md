# Hands On with Leaflet

This section will guide you through building an interactive web map powered by Leaflet. To begin, we will look at the boilerplate code that loads a basemap in order to understand what each element does. Then, we will add data to create an interactive map visualizing parks and points of interest across Vancouver. No prior knowledge of code is necessary.

There are 4 basic component to a Leaflet web map: **Tiles**, **Data**, **Style**, and **Interaction**. These work in concert to power a functioning web map. Over the course of the Hands-On activities that follow, you will have a chance to experiment with each component.
