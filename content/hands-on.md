# Hands On with Leaflet

If you haven't already, be sure to download the workshop data folder somewhere on your physical computer, like Desktop or Downloads. Then, **unzip it**.

There are 4 basic component to a web map: **Tiles**, **Data**, **Style**, and **Interaction**. These work in concert to power a functioning web map. The remainder of this workshop will introduce you to each component through hands-on experimentation. First, we'll look at some code in order to understand the anatomy of a web map powered by Leaflet. Then, you will learn to add and style data, as well as configure the interactivity of your web map. In the end, you will create an interactive map — like that below — visualizing parks and points of interest across Vancouver. No prior knowledge of code is necessary!
