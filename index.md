# Introduction to Web mapping

This is a beginner-level workshop intended for anyone interested in making dynamic and interactive maps. Participants will first be introduced to the concept of a web map, and shown the various tools and platforms available for constructing web maps. A hands-on section will follow, in which the code that powers web maps will be explained and participants given the opportunity to customize provided code in order to make a map of attractions across Vancouver. Upon completion of this workshop, participants will have the fundamental knowledge and skills to begin web mapping on their own.

## Pre-Workshop Setup
All of the data for this workshop is free and openly available. However, to get started you'll need to download and save it to your physical computer (in Desktop or Downloads). During the hands-on portion, you'll work with this data in your source-code editor by copy/pasting the code provided to you. Click on the 'Download Data' button below to start the download. Once complete, **extract the contents of the .zip file**.

[Download Data](content/intro-leaflet-data.zip){: .btn .btn-blue }

### Required Software  
- **Internet browser (and an internet connection)**. The most recent version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org) are recommended. 
- **Source code editor**. To make your life easier while viewing or editing code, it's good to use a [source code editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor). This workshop will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but other editors like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) will work similarly.

Making maps is hard. And, without practice, working in the web is hard too. While there are no prerequisites for this workshop, familiarity with cartographic principles and a basic understanding of what code is and does will make diving into web mapping easier. Refer to these resources at any time:

- **Intro level knowledge of computer programming**. [Matt Adesanya's *A Gentler Introduction to Programming*](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-gentler-introduction-to-programming-1f57383a1b2c/) is a great starting point, and will be more than you need for this workshop.
- **Intro level knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. [Sololearn.com offers several courses on these topics and more](https://www.sololearn.com/Courses/), but there are several other educational resources to choose from on the web if you prefer something different. You're not expected to be a pro for this workshop, but understanding these concepts will provide some very useful perspective.
- **Understanding of basic cartographic design concepts**. What is map making without a consideration of cartography? Axis Maps has written a phenomenal [short guide to cartography](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/), and [the web map module](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/web/should-a-map-be-interactive/) is especially relevant.
