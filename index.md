# Introduction to Web Maps with 
<img src="leaflet_logo.png" alt="Leaflet Logo" style="margin: auto;" />


This beginner-level workshop is intended for anyone interested in getting started creating web maps. This workshop aims to develop the fundamental knowledge and skills to begin web mapping while providing opportunities to ask questions. There are two main sections: an introduction to web maps, and a hands-on where we will will learn to customize [boilerplate code](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/whats-boilerplate-and-why-do-we-use-it-let-s-check-out-the-coding-style-guide-ac2b6c814ee7/) from within a source code editor to make an interactive map of the UBC-V campus powered by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). 

<!-- Upon completion of this workshop you will have the [boilerplate code](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/whats-boilerplate-and-why-do-we-use-it-let-s-check-out-the-coding-style-guide-ac2b6c814ee7/) for a web map which you can build upon and tinker with on your own.  -->

## Pre-Workshop Setup
All of the data for this workshop is free and openly available. However, to get started you'll need to download and save it to your computer. During the hands-on portion you'll work with this data in your source-code editor by copy/pasting the code provided to you. Click on the 'Download Data' button below to start the download. Once complete, **extract the contents of the .zip file**.

[Download Data](content/intro-leaflet-data.zip){: .btn .btn-blue }

### Software Used 
- **Internet browser (and an internet connection)**. The most recent version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org) are recommended. 
- **Source code editor**. To make your life easier while viewing or editing code, it's good to use a [source code editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor). This workshop will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but other editors like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) will work similarly.

Making maps is hard. And, without practice, working in the web is hard too. While there are no prerequisites for this workshop, familiarity with cartographic principles and a basic understanding of what code is and does will make diving into web mapping easier. Refer to these resources at any time:

- **Intro level knowledge of computer programming**. [Matt Adesanya's *A Gentler Introduction to Programming*](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-gentler-introduction-to-programming-1f57383a1b2c/) is a great starting point, and will be more than you need for this workshop.
- **Intro level knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. [Sololearn.com offers several courses on these topics and more](https://www.sololearn.com/Courses/), but there are several other educational resources to choose from on the web if you prefer something different. You're not expected to be a pro for this workshop, but understanding these concepts will provide some very useful perspective.
- **Understanding of basic cartographic design concepts**. What is map making without a consideration of cartography? Axis Maps has written a phenomenal [short guide to cartography](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/), and [the web map module](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/web/should-a-map-be-interactive/) is especially relevant.
